        <h2>Activity 1</h2>
        <li> An IOT application exchanges data with other devices over internet and other communication networks.It uses
            both hardware and software interfaces to connect, collect and analyze massive amount of data in the
            cloud server.These are the applications that can analyze and present captured IoT sensor data to users.
        </li>
        <li>The main features that are needed are Security, Scalability, Connectivity using network deviceâ€™s to use
            interface around the Globe, Dynamic Nature, Personalized interface for user,
            Analyzing the massive data using AI,
            Exchanging data with other devices and
            Databases
        </li>
        <li>Some examples are as follows
            <ul>
                <li>Security System</li>
                <li>Smart Door Lock System</li>
                <li>Smart Light</li>
                <li>Smart Electric Meter</li>
                <li>Smart Home Security System</li>
                <li>Smart Watch / Smart Health Band</li>
                <li>Smart Parking Control System</li>
                <li>Self Driven cars</li>
                <li>Smart Agriculture System and Farming Application</li>
                <li>Smart Pet Feeder</li>
                <li>Smart Eyewear</li>
                <li>Smart Ring</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h2>Activity 2</h2>
        <li> What does smart mean?</li>
        <li> Think of some smart building scenarios where this will be beneficial.</li>
        <li> What are the parts needed for it to work?</li>

        <h2>Activity 3</h2>
        <li> What are the high level features needed for this interface? Think about who will use the interface. </li>
        <li> Who are the users?</li>
        <li> What are the parts needed to make this work?</li>
    </ul>
