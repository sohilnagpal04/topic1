                <li> <b>What is an IoT application?</b> <br>
                    An IOT application exchanges data with other devices over internet and other communication
                    networks.It uses
                    both hardware and software interfaces to connect, collect and analyze massive amount of data in the
                    cloud server.These are the applications that can analyze and present captured IoT sensor data to
                    users. <br>

                    made intelligent with advanced compute to make our everyday life easy which can include AI and
                    machine
                    learning.
                    It perform predefined functions upon detection of specific input and then processes it which is also
                    known
                    as Sense-Think-Act Paradigm.
